# signupLoginWPassportAuth

This an example of an user sign up and login with passport session magament .
The installed dependencies are : express , mongoose , bcryptjs , express-ejs-layouts , ejs , connect-flash , 
express-session , passport , passport-local & nodemon -D .

I highly recommend to read the comments that are next to the code for understand all . There , i clarify for why is each dependency , 
the logic of the functions , how the settings have to be written, etc .
If you can improve the project , do it and then pull a request telling what you´ve changed .

Don´t forget that you can run the app with npm run dev once you installed all the dependecies and set the port .
This is really helpful guide for begginers .
